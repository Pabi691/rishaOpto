    <h1>Measurment of contact lense</h1>


<p>
  <strong>Step 1: A thorough eye examination</strong> <br>
Your eye doctor will first conduct a test that is virtually identical to a standard eye health examination. This is done to make sure you don't have any current medical issues that would prevent you from wearing contacts in a comfortable and healthy way. A slit lamp examination will be performed by your optometrist to carefully examine the inner tissues of your eyes.
<br> <br>

Vision testing is a crucial component of this examination because you need a current prescription for contacts to wear. The following stage is a precise contact lens fitting when it has been verified that your visual condition and ocular health are suitable for contact lenses (these days, there is a contact lens for practically everyone!).
<br><br>
  <strong>Step 2: Frontal clear phoropter contact lens consultation technology</strong> <br>

Given the wide variety of contact lens options available today, your eye doctor will need to know about your lifestyle and daily activities in order to recommend the best lenses for you.
<br> <br>
Consider these issues:
<br>
Do you prefer daily disposable contacts or contacts that may be used for longer periods of time?<br>
Do you wish to alter the colour of your eyes?<br>
Are stiff or soft gas permeable lenses your preference? Ask your eye doctor to go over the advantages and disadvantages of each kind.<br>
If you have presbyopia, would you prefer to wear reading glasses over single-vision contact lenses or are you interested in multifocal contacts? Find out more about monovision from your eye doctor if you have presbyopia.<br>
Do you want to use your contacts every day or just on special occasions and during certain activities?<br>
There are many different types of contact lenses available, therefore the more details you can provide, the easier it will be for your eye doctor to suggest the best contact lens to meet your needs.<br>
<br><br>
  <strong>Third step: contact lens insertion</strong><br>
Various technologies may be employed during your fitting, depending on your eyes. It is crucial to get a precise and thorough fitting because a bad contact lens fit can hurt you or hurt your eye.<br>
<br><br>
Your contact lens prescription is affected by a number of measurements, such as:<br>
corneal bending<br>
The front surface of the eyes, or cornea, where contacts rest, is typically measured by your eye doctor using a keratometer. These figures aid in calculating the base curve and lens diameter listed on your contact lenses prescription.<br>
<br>
A cutting-edge tool called corneal topography maps the curvature of your cornea. When your cornea has an uneven shape, this test is particularly important for guaranteeing an accurate measurement of your corneal curvature. An uneven cornea can be fitted with a variety of specialist contacts. For instance, specific toric lenses may be appropriate for astigmatic patients, and if you have keratoconus, your eye doctor may recommend scleral lenses.
<br><br>
Iris and Pupil Size<br>
These measurements can be made with a hand-held ruler or a slit lamp. The ideal contact lens design for you depends on the size of your pupil and iris. If you're interested in hard gas permeable contact lenses, this information is especially crucial (GP).
<br>
Evaluation of Tear Film<br>
When you have enough lubricating tears to keep both your cornea and your lenses moist, wearing contact lenses is more comfortable. Placing a thin strip of filter paper under your lower lid will allow your eye doctor to examine your tear film. Another treatment that might be performed involves applying liquid dye to your eye and using a slit lamp to examine your tear film. You will need particular contact lens types and materials if you have dry eyes.
<br><br>
  <strong>Time to try a pair of contact lenses in step four.</strong><br>
The easiest approach to judge a great fit after your contact lens fitting is with a pair of trial lenses. Your optometrist will use a slit lamp to evaluate the lenses after they have been placed on your eyes to ensure that they move naturally when you blink and look in all directions. Please let your doctor know if the lenses hurt or if you have any other concerns at this time. You will be given a prescription for contact lenses once a trial pair is determined to be appropriate for you. Your eye doctor will also provide you instructions on how to insert, clean, wear, and take care of your contacts properly.
<br>
Your prescription for contact lenses in Step 5<br>
Typically, a comprehensive prescription for contact lenses include the following details:<br>

Based on the Latin words, the letters OD and OS stand for your right eye (OD) and left eye (OS).<br>

Refractive power, or PWR, is the amount of vision correction required to achieve 20/20 vision. The measurement is in diopters; if there is a minus sign or a plus sign before the value, it indicates nearsightedness or farsightedness, respectively. In most cases, each eye has a separate power.
<br><br>
BC: The Base Curve, which expresses the contact lens's back curvature and is expressed in millimetres, is this. The figure matches the curvature of your cornea. Some contact lens manufacturers only offer one base curve.
<br><br>
DIA: Your contact lens's diameter, which is also measured in millimetres, is the distance across the lens surface. The number is typically between 13 and 15. When this value is inappropriate for you, the contact lens will feel uncomfortable because it will affect how the contact lens fits on your eye.
<br><br>
The following details are also provided if you need toric lenses for astigmatism:
<br><br>
CYL: Cylinder value, which is typically between -4 and +4, is the force needed to correct astigmatism.
<br><br>
Axis: Expressing the orientation of the cylinder value on the lens in degrees, the axis
<br><br>
Your prescription for contact lenses will also specify whether you require bifocal or multifocal lenses if you do:
<br><br>
The term "ADD: The Add Power" describes the amount of magnification required in specific areas of the lens to facilitate close-up vision.
<br><br>
If your eye doctor suggests a certain brand of contact lenses for your eyes, your prescription can include that brand. Your specific requests for cosmetic coloured lenses will also be noted. The prescription may specify how frequently you should throw away and replace your lenses.
<br><br>
  <strong>Step 5: Visits for follow-up</strong><br>
You will require follow-up appointments to make sure your contact lenses stay in place and give you clear vision. To ensure that your eyes can accept contacts without any issues, your eye specialist will also check the condition of your eyes. Sometimes it's necessary to change the brand, material, or wearing schedule of your contacts.
